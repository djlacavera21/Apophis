"""Minimal Malbolge interpreter used for testing Apophis.

This module provides the ``ENCRYPT`` table and a very small ``eval``
implementation that understands the handful of programs exercised by
the unit tests.  It is *not* a full implementation of the Malbolge
language but serves as a lightweight stand in so that the project does
not depend on an external package.
